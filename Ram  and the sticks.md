RAM AND THE STICKS

Ram is given n sticks.A stick is is good if it is taller than the stick before it and after it.Ram can add some extra length(integer) to the end of sticks.He wants to maximize the number of good sticks.His aim is to add minimum length of sticks to the end of sticks.

NOTE-The first and last sticks cannot be good

Input The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (3≤n≤105) — the number of sticks given to Ram.

The second line of each test case contains n integers l1,l2,...,ln (1≤li≤109) — the length of sticks given to Ram.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum length of stick Ram needs to add in order to maximize the number of good sticks.
