Hint: Think about the cases of n even and odd. Solution: When n is odd since the first and last are not the answers therefore the sticks which can be good are 2,4,6,...,n-1.So,we need to check if the ith stick is presently larger than the (i-1)th and (i+1)th stick,otherwise add the length required to make it taller than the two. When n is even,in one case we can leave two consecutive sticks to find out the best method.Now we have to find the best case.So, we can find out the sum of sticks required by leaving one and store in two arrays separately. Now,we can find out the case which is the best easily because the total sum will be sum till one index of one array and then from the same index of another array.
